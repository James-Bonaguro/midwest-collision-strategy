Midwest Collision Repair Advisory: Strategic Thesis

This repository contains the interactive market validation and Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy for my advisory practice targeting independent collision repair shop owners in the Midwest.

🎯 The Objective

I am building a specialized advisory firm for independent shop owners (revenue $500k-$5M) in IL, IN, WI, MI, and OH. This single-page application serves as a dynamic whitepaper, visualizing the data behind the business case.

🧠 The Thesis

The industry is crowded with generic consultants, but there is a specific gap for "Insider" advisory. This strategy rests on three pillars validated in this visualization:

The "Bleeding Neck" Problem: The data confirms that labor shortages (100k+ gap) and succession planning are existential threats for owners, far outweighing daily operational annoyances.

The "Insider" Leverage: My background combining CCC Intelligent Solutions experience (software/data) with family dealership operations creates a unique "trust wedge" that generic consultants cannot replicate.

The "Trojan Horse" GTM: A "give first" distribution model using high-value research briefs to build authority before offering paid advisory.

📊 Visualized Data

The index.html file renders a dashboard validating:

Technician Shortage Forecast (2024-2028): The structural labor cliff.

Market Pressure: The consolidation squeeze (Independents vs. PE/MSOs).

Pain Point Severity: Ranking business problems by urgency vs. annoyance.

Channel Efficiency: An "Effort vs. Impact" analysis of where I will reach these owners.

🛠 Tech Stack

Designed for zero-maintenance hosting and portability:

Single-File Architecture: No build steps, no frameworks.

Visualization: Chart.js (standard metrics) & Plotly.js (statistical analysis).

Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN).

Assets: Unicode icons (no SVG/image dependencies).
