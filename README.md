🎯 Strategic Context

This project visualizes market research data to validate an advisory business model targeting independent shop owners (revenue $500k-$5M) in IL, IN, WI, MI, and OH.

Key Hypotheses Validated:

The "Bleeding Neck" Problem: Labor shortages and succession planning are the top existential threats, outweighing operational issues.

The "Insider" Advantage: A founder with CCC Intelligent Solutions & dealership background has a distinct competitive advantage over generic consultants.

The Model: A "Free Value" (Trojan Horse) approach using high-quality research briefs to build trust before paid advisory.

📊 Visualizations Included

Labor Market Forecast (2024-2028): Visualizing the 100k+ technician shortage (Chart.js Line).

Market Pressure: The squeeze of Independents vs. MSOs/PE (Chart.js Donut).

Pain Point Ranking: Weighted severity of business problems (Chart.js Horizontal Bar).

Channel Strategy: Effort vs. Impact analysis for outreach channels (Plotly.js Bubble Chart).

Strategy Roadmap: A visual flow from free briefs to paid advisory services.
